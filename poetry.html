This poem was part of an unfinished series called !?: poems for the wayward and the wanting, the wandering and the wondering.

####Lost
in a torrent like a whirlwind like
a windstorm like a stone without moss
without mass without weight with all the
weight in the world of the world on your
shoulders. Those shoulders made giants, they
say. It pains me greatly to be this tall and be
expected to still be great. This lost is like a
dream exploded, expressed in “the rest” and
“the other” life. You could say it’s like a
mother to me, because I’m nurtured by the
nothing of lost, because my milk is made of
little hopes, of shrapnel dreams and wishing
motes. The air polluted of diluted dreams is
whiskey to my breath, intoxicating mystery
that nullifies the fear of death. I miss my
grandma, yeah, I miss her good. My missing is
a mission that I organize a brotherhood, that I
tell the world my story, that I send my friends
my fate because “Lord knows” no Lord of
mine will be watching His calendar to check
my date. And when my blood has run my
veins and pain is all I know, I’ll know if I have
spent my days in vain by never always losing.

And so in seven days, Good created light and
dark, plants and animals, and He named them
after Himself. And He created Atom and Evil,
and cared about them most. And Evil said,
“There is much to gain,” and Atom said,
“There is much to learn,” and yea, it was so.
By the eighth day, Good had given Himself to
his creations, and existed in fragments, in the
seeds of trees and the eyes of dogs, in the
heart of chimps and the soul of man. And
man’s soul would be so Good that it was
hidden from Atom and Evil, so that they may
not find the essence of Good. And Atom
declared this the objective. And Atom and
Evil would spend the rest of their lives
searching for the Good in man.

If Atom and Evil find Good, turn to page 41.
If Atom and Evil find nothing, turn to page 1.

(Untitled ode to wonder)

Rain-speckled window thirty floors high
covers the office from the gray wall sky
Eyes fixed on a young boy across the line
staring out a window just like mine
His eyes seem to catch in the gentle breeze
and I wonder what I don't that he sees

#### Thirty Days

Thirty days has September
April, March, and November.
Twenty days has May and June,
The longest season of the bloom -
July and August, three or four,
October's usu'lly variable.
But as November fades away,
No longer is there time of day
But rather, cold, eternal night -
Snow freezes over,
Wind breaks on cheeks,
And - lest they touch ground - She ices tears -
In those three months I live three years.

####When love and words are all a-fluster
(Author's note: an ode to one of my favorite poets)

To let things flow freely
&emsp;&emsp; with the art of a master,
is, yes, I admit,
&emsp;&emsp; just a little bit harder
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and your wit must be quickened
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; and slickened
And your lines have to come about seven beats faster.
And what seems random and arbitrary,
&emsp;&emsp; jumbled like a bumbled mess,
&emsp;&emsp; and comes out, let's face it,
&emsp;&emsp; all willy-nilly to us,
Is some cleverly fixed,
&emsp;&emsp; dressed and humbled
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; way to stretch
&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; just for a rhyme
&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; and not fall victim
&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; to the supercilious.
-- But it's had my mind mired and tortured and bogged in...

Who the hell names their kid Ogden?

####Untitled eulogy to a girl who died before I could meet her
(Author's note: When I was preparing to attend Colgate University, so was Merritt Levitan, a young woman I didn't know and now won't ever know. She was on a cross-country bicycle trip when a reckless driver killed her. Everything I felt about that news went into this poem.)


*Here lies Merritt Levitan, the strongest girl I never knew
Were I to boast that I’m still whole, then I’d be lying too.*

And the waters calm began to rage
and swell a force upon this page,
no doubt the seeds of iron hate
against the murderer’s mistake.

Move on, they whisper,
our story lies above.
move on, they whisper,
our story is of love.

A warrior beauty, a princess of dress,
a Raider, of course, the well-worthy best
she conquered the world.

she could have conquered the world.

and she did, and she did
they echo her shouts

the sun casts great shadows
but it never goes out.

the girl I loved but never knew:
a great within the mighty few -
i’ll never rest, despondent of
the breathless heart, the brighted cause.

the city party chattered on
like drones oblivious to dawn
a pity (?) shame or tragedy
invisible to all but me.

colors dried
drained from her smile
and just for a while
we cried.
