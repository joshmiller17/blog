		<h4>Another Coffee? (2020)</h4>

		<h4>Roll (2019)</h4>
		<img src="assets/Roll2019.gif" style="float:right" alt="(Screenshots of Roll)">
		<div class="float-body">
		This tiny game began as the Roll-A-Ball Unity tutorial, and 4 hours later I had accidentally made a game during the global game jam. The game plays on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">spoon theory</a> in a way that reflects (some of) my experiences with depression — the hardest part of getting better is getting started.

		<a href="assets/MorningRoutines.zip"><img src="assets/Morning2018.png" style="float:left" width="500" height="500" alt="(Screenshot of Morning Routines. Click to download game.)"></a>
		<div class="float-body">
		This game was made as a one-day game jam (with some post-jam polish) to explore the feelings of OCD. In this game, you first play as a neurotypical person preparing for the day while late for work. Then the game switches to that same situation for someone with obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. While the end product resulted in more confusion than frustration (the UI isn't great at informing the player what compulsive behaviors to perform), we did end up with a shippable experience that tries to bring attention to this particular mental health struggle. Made with Godot; Credits (details in game files): Abdel-Rahman Madkour, Feyyaz Sonbudak, Clarence Hann, and myself. <b>Click the image to download the game.</b>

		<h4 style="clear:left;">Descent Into Madness (2016)</h4>
		<img src="assets/descentintomadness.jpg" style="float:right" width="500" alt="Descent Into Madness cover">
		<div class="float-body">
		This one-shot tabletop RPG system was made for a friend who was exploring the life of H.P. Lovecraft for her senior thesis. This Lovecraftian horror game is designed to encourage the party to split up, isolate each other, cast away their only strength, and descend into an isolated tragedy trying to comprehend the cosmic chaos that is an uncontrollable universe. It makes use of a Jenga tower as the primary mechanic (coincidentally, before I'd learned of Dread) as well as a withering limited pool of card resources and a timing dynamic that gives you an increased sense of panic when trying to do something your character hasn't practiced. Published in an indie game anthology, available <a href="https://pizzapranks.itch.io/indiepocalypse-1">here</a>.

		<h4 style="clear:left;">Vennt (2015-)</h4>
		<div class="float-body">
		Vennt is a steampunk fantasy tabletop RPG about teamwork, discovery, and choice. It is still in development and has undergone approximately one radical revision per year. Despite being rules-heavy, Vennt is designed as an exercise in onboarding and unfolding play to ensure that beginner players with no RPG experience can pick up and play. In its current form, Vennt is classless, raceless, and narrative-focused with intense tactical intermissions to create a cycle of tension and release. The game has a <a href="https://discord.gg/dPzRrXp">Discord server</a>, which you're welcome to join!

		<h4 style="clear:left;">Signal Ninja (2019)</h4>
		<div class="float-body">
		Signal Ninja was a prototype proposed as part of a research project on a citizen science game for annotating human activity accelerometer data — in other words, a game about labeling motion data (like from a Fitbit) so researchers can train an algorithm to do that labeling automatically. This game design doc (GDD) was a way for me to organize my thoughts before prototyping the game, which took about 6 hours. This prototype was successful in that it helped us quickly steer away from a fast-action mobile game to a more strategic puzzle game by proving that the concept wouldn't meet our design demands. <a href=assets/GDDSignalNinja.pdf download>Download the GDD.</a>
