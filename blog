## Games I've Played: A Collection of Design Notes
Author's Note: This is by no means a list of all of the games I've played. This list doesn't include:
* Games I can't remember well from my childhood
* Games I simply forgot to include
* Games I played but not well enough to have commentary on
* Games I played but are too similar to another game on the list to have commentary on

Author's Note 2: This is a project I've just recently started, so most entries are blank.
<b> Digital Games Complete: 2 / 89 </b>

The developers have made significant progress on this game since I played it last, but when I was playing it, this game was Minecraft skewed toward Resident Evil. Interestingly, by adding extra challenge (Schell #38) and leaning into the survival horror nature, the lack of freedom (Schell #79) helped me narrow my focus and set goals (Schell #32) for making progress in the game. It didn't feel as grindy as Minecraft can sometimes feel because I was always lacking every resource, so every resource was a meaningful reward (Schell #46) for my efforts. Even when I became powerful (in the sense of resource accumulation), nearly every resource still had value to my survival, and the game created enough ramping challenge to continuously keep me in a flow state for hours.

Antichamber is a first-person puzzle game with a "solution gun," and in that way it's within the same genre, you could say, as Portal. What makes this game stand out, as developer Alexander Bruce claims, is that it forces you to re-think in non-Euclidean geometry, question your assumptions about the world's space, and ultimately see the world in a new perspective (as the best puzzles (Schell #58) often have you do). This is reinforced by the elegance and visual clarity of the art style, simplifying the world to pure white (background) and bright colors (foreground). The gameplay loop is one of probing (Gee #15), forming a hypothesis, testing it, and iterating until you understand how the game world works. But what stood out to me while playing were the signposts that marked each puzzle (also called Morals by the Antichamber fandom). 
<img src="antichamber2.png" align="left" hspace="25" vspace="25" alt="Antichamber Moral/Sign Screenshot">
These signs show a cartoon, and interacting with the sign reveals a caption, a lesson to be learned from the puzzle. The one shown here says "Some choices leave us running around a lot without really getting anywhere." This message is revealed when we come to a dead end with no return, and the sign is meant to teach the player how to warp back to the starting area.
Why did I enjoy these signs so much? Maybe they served as the main story thread of Antichamber, or maybe the little cartoons were the content reward for solving a puzzle. But I think the real answer is that the signs marked my progress, not just in the game, but as a person. By solving the puzzle, I demonstrated that I have internally understood this moral, and I can apply it to solve my problems. Many of the morals are about learning iterative thinking, the kind which is used for problem- and puzzle-solving. I liked Antichamber because it gave me a sense of personal growth and transformation (Schell #110).

#### Accelerant (LARP system)
I had the pleasure of playing an NPC in the Shadowvale LARP in 2018, my first LARP ever in fact. Although I can't speak to what this game is like from a player's perspective, or even how this system compares to other LARP systems, I can speak to what larping as an activity felt like to a newcomer. Much like a board game, a larp is all rules up front, against Gee's principle of performance before competence. Of course, some rules are used more often than others, so if you have experienced players to mentor you in (and you usually do), they can emphasize which rules are most important. According to my second-hand knowledge speaking with other players, Accelerant does succeed in having a minimal core ruleset, and I personally didn't have a difficult time grasping the core rules, but it certainly took conscious effort.
The second design aspect worth noting is combat. Here again, Accelerant has a tight core ruleset and a simplified "callout" system for real-time combat (in constrast, I hear, to earlier LARP systems which had more complexity to the callouts). Yet - and this is a problem I imagine is shared across larping in general - combat had a social etiquette to it, giving balance a nebulous quality, like that of tabletop RPGs. Did that hit land? What can I and can't I do with my weapons? Even among veteran players there was debate, which I read as the mark of an unclear system. Of course, when dealing with social games, a lack of clarity is to some extent expected. The problem is difficult. But that doesn't mean we can't improve as designers by trying to craft better systems. How to solve the problems of combat remains unclear, and the issue is too complex to warrant describing here, but it suffices to say that my frustrations with the ambiguity of the system took away my enjoyment of what the experience was supposed to offer - a seamless integration of game mechanics and real, physical combat.
Overall, in my personal taste, the Accelerant system is incredibly interesting as a design challenge, but the next time I play for the pleasure of roleplayed socializing, I'll be staying off the battlefield.
