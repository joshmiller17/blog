	This page is a tribute to my friend Dan Power who I haven't seen since 2009. This picture is of him from 2006.
	<br>
	If you found this link, you probably clicked on the DP in his game. That button used to go to his website, but the domain expired so I had to mod it to point to this tribute page and not some advertising company.
	<br>
	Dan was... a fun person. Sometimes critical and narrow-minded, but deep down I think he wanted to change. At least I hope he did. I haven't seen him in over 10 years, so part of me making this tribute page is to help find him. If you see Dan or know anything about him, please email me at josh@joshaaronmiller.com and let me know.
	<br>
	Thanks.
