	<h3>Something hopeful</h3>
	<h4>(Untitled ode to wonder)</h4>
	Rain-speckled window thirty floors high
	covers the office from the gray wall sky
	Eyes fixed on a young boy across the line
	staring out a window just like mine
	His eyes seem to catch in the gentle breeze
	and I wonder what I don't that he sees

	<h3>Something silly</h3>
	<h4>When love and words are all a-fluster</h4>
	(Author's note: an ode to one of my favorite poets)
	<br>
	To let things flow freely
	&emsp;&emsp; with the art of a master,
	is, yes, I admit,
	&emsp;&emsp; just a little bit harder
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and your wit must be quickened
	&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; and slickened
	And your lines have to come about seven beats faster.
	And what seems random and arbitrary,
	&emsp;&emsp; jumbled like a bumbled mess,
	&emsp;&emsp; and comes out, let's face it,
	&emsp;&emsp; all willy-nilly to us,
	Is some cleverly fixed,
	&emsp;&emsp; dressed and humbled
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; way to stretch
	&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; just for a rhyme
	&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; and not fall victim
	&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; to the supercilious.
	-- But it's had my mind mired and tortured and bogged in...

	<h4>Lost</h4>
	in a torrent like a whirlwind like
	a windstorm like a stone without moss
	without mass without weight with all the
	weight in the world of the world on your
	shoulders. Those shoulders made giants, they
	say. It pains me greatly to be this tall and be
	expected to still be great. This lost is like a
	dream exploded, expressed in “the rest” and
	“the other” life. You could say it’s like a
	mother to me, because I’m nurtured by the
	nothing of lost, because my milk is made of
	little hopes, of shrapnel dreams and wishing
	motes. The air polluted of diluted dreams is
	whiskey to my breath, intoxicating mystery
	that nullifies the fear of death. I miss my
	grandma, yeah, I miss her good. My missing is
	a mission that I organize a brotherhood, that I
	tell the world my story, that I send my friends
	my fate because “Lord knows” no Lord of
	mine will be watching His calendar to check
	my date. And when my blood has run my
	veins and pain is all I know, I’ll know if I have
	spent my days in vain by never always losing.
	<br>
	And so in seven days, Good created light and
	dark, plants and animals, and He named them
	after Himself. And He created Atom and Evil,
	and cared about them most. And Evil said,
	“There is much to gain,” and Atom said,
	“There is much to learn,” and yea, it was so.
	By the eighth day, Good had given Himself to
	his creations, and existed in fragments, in the
	seeds of trees and the eyes of dogs, in the
	heart of chimps and the soul of man. And
	man’s soul would be so Good that it was
	hidden from Atom and Evil, so that they may
	not find the essence of Good. And Atom
	declared this the objective. And Atom and
	Evil would spend the rest of their lives
	searching for the Good in man.
	<br>
	If Atom and Evil find Good, turn to page 41.
	If Atom and Evil find nothing, turn to page 1.

	<h3>Eulogy to a girl who died before I could meet her</h3>
	<h4>Untitled eulogy to a girl who died before I could meet her</h4>
	(Author's note: When I was preparing to attend Colgate University, so was Merritt Levitan, a young woman I didn't know and now won't ever know. She was on a cross-country bicycle trip when a reckless driver killed her. Everything I felt about that news went into this poem.)
	<br>
	<i>Here lies Merritt Levitan, the strongest girl I never knew
	Were I to boast that I’m still whole, then I’d be lying too.</i>
	<br>
	And the waters calm began to rage
	and swell a force upon this page,
	no doubt the seeds of iron hate
	against the murderer’s mistake.
	<br>
	Move on, they whisper,
	our story lies above.
	move on, they whisper,
	our story is of love.
	<br>
	A warrior beauty, a princess of dress,
	a Raider, of course, the well-worthy best
	she conquered the world.
	<br>
	she could have conquered the world.
	<br>
	and she did, and she did
	they echo her shouts
	<br>
	the sun casts great shadows
	but it never goes out.
	<br>
	the girl I loved but never knew:
	a great within the mighty few -
	i’ll never rest, despondent of
	the breathless heart, the brighted cause.
	<br>
	the city party chattered on
	like drones oblivious to dawn
	a pity (?) shame or tragedy
	invisible to all but me.
	<br>
	colors dried
	drained from her smile
	and just for a while
	we cried.

	<h3>Regarding seasonal affective disorder</h3>

	<h4>Thirty Days</h4>

	Thirty days has September
	April, March, and November.
	Twenty days has May and June,
	The longest season of the bloom -
	July and August, three or four,
	October's usu'lly variable.
	But as November fades away,
	No longer is there time of day
	But rather, cold, eternal night -
	Snow freezes over,
	Wind breaks on cheeks,
	And - lest they touch ground - She ices tears -
	In those three months I live three years.
