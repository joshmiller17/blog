	<h3>Digital Games</h3>
	<h4>Roll (2019)</h4>
	This tiny game began as the Roll-A-Ball Unity tutorial, and 4 hours later I had accidentally made a game during the global game jam. The game plays on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">spoon theory</a> in a way that reflects (some of) my experiences with depression - the hardest part of getting better is getting started.

	<h4>Morning Routines (2018)</h4>
	This game was made as a one-day game jam (with some post-jam polish) to explore the feelings of OCD. In this game, you first play as a neurotypical person preparing for the day while late for work. Then the game switches to that same situation for someone with obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. While the end product resulted in more confusion than frustration (the UI isn't great at informing the player what compulsive behaviors to perform), we did end up with a shippable experience that tries to bring attention to this particular mental health struggle. Made with Godot; Credits (details in game files): Abdel-Rahman Madkour, Feyyaz Sonbudak, Clarence Hann, and myself. <b>Click the image to download the game.</b>

	<h3>Tabletop Design</h3>
	<h4>Descent Into Madness (2016)</h4>
	This one-shot tabletop RPG was made for a friend who was exploring the life of H.P. Lovecraft for her senior thesis. This Lovecraftian horror game is designed to encourage the party to split up, isolate each other, cast away their only strength, and descend into an isolated tragedy trying to comprehend the cosmic chaos that is an uncontrollable universe. It makes use of a Jenga tower as the primary mechanic (coincidentally, before I'd learned of Dread) as well as a withering limited pool of card resources and a timing dynamic that gives you an increased sense of panic when trying to do something your character hasn't practiced. <b>Click the rules and character sheet to download.</b>

	<h4>Vennt (2015-)</h4>
	Vennt is a steampunk fantasy tabletop RPG about teamwork, discovery, and choice. It is still in development and has undergone approximately one radical revision per year. Despite being rules-heavy, Vennt is designed as an exercise in onboarding and unfolding play, to ensure that beginner players with no RPG experience can pick up and play. In its current form, Vennt is classless, raceless, card-based, grid-based, and narrative-focused with intense tactical intermissions to create a cycle of tension and release. The game has a Discord server, which you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/dPzRrXp">here</a>.

	<h3>Design Doc Samples</h3>
	For other samples of design, check out my <a href="blog">collection of design notes</a>.
	<h4>Signal Ninja (2019)</h4>
	Signal Ninja was a prototypes proposed as part of a research project on a citizen science game for annotating human activity accelerometer data - in other words, a game about labeling motion data (like from a Fitbit) so researchers can train an algorithm to do that labeling automatically. This game design doc (GDD) was a way for me to organize my thoughts before prototyping the game, which took about 6 hours. This prototype was successful in that it helped us quickly steer away from a fast-action mobile game to a more strategic puzzle game by proving that the concept wouldn't meet our design demands. <a href=assets/GDDSignalNinja.pdf download>Download the GDD.</a>

	<h3>Writing</h4>
	<h4>The Dreamer (2012)</h4>
	This book began with the 2011 NaNoWriMo challenge, and after succeeding I spent a year polishing it and self-published the following November. The book is available for purchase <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreamer-Josh-Miller-ebook/dp/B00AFMVKBG/">here</a>.
	<h4>Prose and Poetry (2010-2013)</h4>
	In my high school years, I wrote many pages of poetry and short fiction. I've included a sampling here. Would you like to go exploring? What are you in the mood for?
