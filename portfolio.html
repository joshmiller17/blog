		This one-shot tabletop RPG system was made for a friend who was exploring the life of H.P. Lovecraft for her senior thesis. This Lovecraftian horror game is designed to encourage the party to split up, isolate each other, cast away their only strength, and descend into an isolated tragedy trying to comprehend the cosmic chaos that is an uncontrollable universe. It makes use of a Jenga tower as the primary mechanic (coincidentally, before I'd learned of Dread) as well as a withering limited pool of card resources and a timing dynamic that gives you an increased sense of panic when trying to do something your character hasn't practiced. Published in an indie game anthology, available <a href="https://pizzapranks.itch.io/indiepocalypse-1">here</a>.
