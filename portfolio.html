		<div class="float-body">
		This 10 minute interactive fiction was made for the 2020 Global Game Jam "Repair." Our team's take on the theme was a game about repairing an estranged relationship. After the jam, I spent the next year (on and off) polishing the game and released it during the following year's jam.

		<img src="assets/mino_banner.png" style="float:left" width="800" alt="Expanded logo of Mino showing amino acids as cartoon characters.">
		<div class="float-body">
		Mino is a cooperative strategy board game about amino acids. In this game, players match amino acids to their properties on a grid in order to form hydrogen bonds and make a protein before it denatures. Mino is still in development (on hiatus), but I'm particularly proud of the art style it has so far. Check out how I provided art direction in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CsSLMFga8AXva5PvLnYxVH6M0mJxqTlXW_iPfia8hoo/edit?usp=sharing">style guide / art bible</a> I wrote.

		<img src="assets/descentintomadness.jpg" style="float:right" width="500" alt="Descent Into Madness cover">
		<div class="float-body">
		This one-shot tabletop RPG system was made for a friend who was exploring the life of H.P. Lovecraft for her senior thesis. This Lovecraftian horror game is designed to encourage the party to split up, isolate each other, cast away their only strength, and descend into an isolated tragedy trying to comprehend the cosmic chaos that is an uncontrollable universe. It makes use of a Jenga tower as the primary mechanic (coincidentally, before I'd learned of Dread) as well as a withering limited pool of card resources and a timing dynamic that gives you an increased sense of panic when trying to do something your character hasn't practiced. Published in 2020 in the Indiepocalypse anthology of indie games, volume 1. Available <a href="https://pizzapranks.itch.io/indiepocalypse-1">here</a>.
