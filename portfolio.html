		<div class="float-body">
		This 10 minute interactive fiction was made for the 2020 Global Game Jam "Repair." Our team's take on the theme was a game about repairing an estranged relationship. After the jam, I spent the next year (on and off) polishing the game and released it during the following year's jam.

	<h4 style="clear:left;">Descent Into Madness (2016)</h4>
		<img src="assets/descentintomadness.jpg" style="float:right" width="500" alt="Descent Into Madness cover">
		<div class="float-body">
		This one-shot tabletop RPG system was made for a friend who was exploring the life of H.P. Lovecraft for her senior thesis. This Lovecraftian horror game is designed to encourage the party to split up, isolate each other, cast away their only strength, and descend into an isolated tragedy trying to comprehend the cosmic chaos that is an uncontrollable universe. It makes use of a Jenga tower as the primary mechanic (coincidentally, before I'd learned of Dread) as well as a withering limited pool of card resources and a timing dynamic that gives you an increased sense of panic when trying to do something your character hasn't practiced. Published in an indie game anthology, available <a href="https://pizzapranks.itch.io/indiepocalypse-1">here</a>.
